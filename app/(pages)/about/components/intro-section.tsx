        My name is Kyaw Thu, and a lot of people know me as Evan. I have born
        and raised in Burma (Myanmar), and I am currently living in Taiwan. I am

        I have spent 7 years studying medicine at the University of Medicine 1,
        Yangon. Due to several reasons, including pandemic, I had to drop out of
        the university. For as long as I can remember, I have always been into
        technology and working with computers. In 2021, I started learning
        programming with Python, which made me love programming even more.

        After exploring several career options, I was quickly drawn to front-end
        web development. I started learning HTML and CSS to build simple
        websites. Fascinated with how intricate web development can be, I was
        quickly drawn to learn more. I started learning JavaScript and was even
        more enthused with making websites interactive. I am now spending my
        time building projects with React JS, Next JS, Tailwind CSS, and MongoDB
        and learning new technologies.

        occasionally. My favorite NBA team is Golden State Warriors.
